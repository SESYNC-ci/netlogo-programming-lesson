## Creating Monitors

Use the monitor to get real-time reporting on the states of model entities.

Just like creating a button, create a monitor by clicking the Add icon on the toolbar, selecting Monitor next to it, and clicking on an open spot in the Interface. 

A dialog box will appear.

- In the dialog type: count turtles. 
- Press the OK button to close the dialog. 

`turtles` is an "agentset", the set of all turtles.

### Create another Monitor 

Create a monitor by clicking the Add icon on the toolbar, selecting Monitor next to it, and clicking on an open spot in the Interface. 

A dialog box will appear.

- In the Reporter section of the dialog box type: count patches with [pcolor = green]. 
- In the Display name section of the dialog box type: grass patches 
- Press the OK button to close the dialog box. 

Use the setup and go buttons and watch the numbers in the monitors change.

Green sticky notes when you get this to work.
