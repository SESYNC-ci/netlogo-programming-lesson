## Final Note

Don't forget to comment your code! It has been said that best practice is at least 50% of your key strokes should be comments. Comments let you mix an explanation the code right in with the code itself. You might use comments to help others understand your model, or you might use them as notes to yourself.

Comments begin with ";;" and continue to the end of the line. In the Code tab, comments are gray, so your eyes can pick them out easily.
